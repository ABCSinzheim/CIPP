**Welcome to the CIPP New Interface Beta Program! ðŸš€**

Weâ€™re excited to have you on board for the **CIPP New Interface Release Candidate Beta**! Youâ€™ve successfully enabled beta access via the management portal, and this page provides all the important details you need to ensure a smooth experience.

***

### **What You Need to Know**

#### **Feedback and Reporting**

Your feedback is critical in helping us improve the new interface. Hereâ€™s how to share your thoughts and experiences:

* **Primary Channel**: Use [Discord](https://discord.gg/9avVA2Hs) for all beta-related feedback, discussions, and questions.
  * By giving us your Discord username you will have been already added to the dedicated beta feedback channel here: [**#new-ui-beta**](https://discord.com/channels/905453405936447518/1318251404846043176)
* **GitHub**: Avoid creating GitHub issues unless you are an existing contributor. This keeps GitHub focused on actionable tasks for the dev team.

***

#### **Important Beta Warnings**

The beta version is a **work in progress**, so unexpected issues may occur. Please keep the following in mind:

1. **No Official Support**:
   * Beta support is limited to **community discussions** in Discord.
   * While weâ€™ll monitor feedback closely, official support for beta-related issues is not provided at this time.
2. **Potential Issues**:
   * Loss of previous settings or configurations.
   * Login errors or disruptions to system access.
   * Alerts, monitoring tools, or other automated tasks may stop functioning.
3. **Backup & Rollback**:
   * You are responsible for creating a backup **before enabling the beta**. This includes user profiles, personal settings, alerts, and other configurations.
   * If needed, you can **roll back** to the previous version using the management portal, but this requires **restoring from a backup you created prior to migration.**
4. **No Documentation Yet**:
   * Documentation for the new interface is still under development and not yet available.

***

### **What to Expect**

By enabling the beta, your **live environment** has been switched to the new interface and its features.

* **Irreversible Change**: Rolling back requires a full restore from the backup you created prior to enabling the beta.
* **Exclusively for Hosted Users**: The beta program is currently available only for **hosted CIPP sponsors**. Self-hosted availability will be announced at a later date.

### **Known Issues and Workarounds**

Below is a list of identified issues and their current status as reported in Discord. Follow up there with any questions or for further discussion on any issues.

***

1. **Error:** `"(intermediate value).some is not a function"`
   * **Scenario 1: Standards Migration Dropdown Error**
     * **Cause**: During migration, if only one **Action** was selected, it was saved as an object instead of an array.
     * **Status**: A fix has been applied to enforce the correct format during migration. This issue should no longer occur. If you still encounter this, report it in Discord.
   * **Scenario 2: Offboarding Wizard Dropdown Error**
     * **Cause**: Old user defaults (e.g., saved users) conflict with the new version.
     * **Workaround**:
       1. Go to **Profile â†’ Settings**.
       2. Refresh the page, toggle any checkbox, and save.
       3. Refresh the entire page again.
       4. If the issue persists, **clear cookies and local storage** to reset settings.
2. **Dashboard Error:** Partner Tenant Issues
   * **Issue**: Selecting the **partner tenant** or viewing dashboards with all tenants causes 500 errors.
   * **Status**: Being investigated. If you encounter this, report it in Discord.

#### **General Advice**

* Clear cookies and local storage to resolve lingering UI conflicts.
* Report unresolved issues with detailed steps, screenshots, and error messages in the [**#new-ui-beta**](https://discord.com/channels/905453405936447518/1318251404846043176) Discord channel.
