### **What You Need to Know**

#### **Feedback and Reporting**

Your feedback is critical in helping us improve the new interface. Hereâ€™s how to share your thoughts and experiences:

* **Primary Channel**: Use [Discord](https://discord.gg/9avVA2Hs) for all beta-related feedback, discussions, and questions.
  * By giving us your Discord username you will have been already added to the dedicated beta feedback channel here: [**#new-ui-beta**](https://discord.com/channels/905453405936447518/1318251404846043176)
* **GitHub**: Avoid creating GitHub issues unless you are an existing contributor. This keeps GitHub focused on actionable tasks for the dev team.

#### **Important Beta Warnings**

The beta version is a **work in progress**, so unexpected issues may occur. Please keep the following in mind:

1. **No Official Support**:
   * Beta support is limited to **community discussions** in Discord.
   * While weâ€™ll monitor feedback closely, official support for beta-related issues is not provided at this time.
2. **Potential Issues**:
   * Loss of previous settings or configurations.
   * Login errors or disruptions to system access.
   * Alerts, monitoring tools, or other automated tasks may stop functioning.
3. **Backup & Rollback**:
   * You are responsible for creating a backup **before enabling the beta**. This includes user profiles, personal settings, alerts, and other configurations.
   * If needed, you can **roll back** to the previous version using the management portal, but this requires **restoring from a backup you created prior to migration.**
4. **No Documentation Yet**:
   * Documentation for the new interface is still under development and not yet available.

### **What to Expect**

By enabling the beta, your **live environment** has been switched to the new interface and its features.

* **Irreversible Change**: Rolling back requires a full restore from the backup you created prior to enabling the beta.
