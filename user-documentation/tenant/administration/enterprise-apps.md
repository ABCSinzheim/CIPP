# Enterprise Applications

This page shows all the enterprise applications that are available in the tenant.\
This can for example be very helpful when trying to identify SAM applications from previous MSPs.\
To do this, first clear the filter and then select the `All non-Microsoft Enterprise Apps` filter. If not done in this order, the filter will not work as expected.
