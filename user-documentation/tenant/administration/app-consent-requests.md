# App Consent Requests

This page shows all the app consent requests that have been made in the tenant.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Please note:** App consent requests are only available for tenants that have disabled user consent for applications or have the `Require admin consent for applications` standard enabled.\
To not miss any requests, it is recommended to set up the Scripted CIPP Alert `Alert on new apps in the application approval list`.
