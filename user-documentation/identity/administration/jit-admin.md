# JIT Admin

Ensure temporary admin accounts aren't left active. CIPP lets you create accounts with specific roles as needed and easily removes them automatically when no longer required.

Accounts can be scheduled, or immediately enabled.

A Temporary Access Pass(TAP) can be generated at the creation of the JIT admin, to satisfy the need for strong authentication/MFA.

{% hint style="warning" %}
To use Temporary Access Passes (TAP), you must enable the authentication method in the customer tenant. \
This can be done easily via the CIPP Entra Standard: ["Enable Temporary Access Passwords"](../../tenant/standards/list-standards/entra-aad-standards.md)
{% endhint %}
